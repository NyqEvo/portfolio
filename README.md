# Protfolio Homework

## Description

This is a mock portfolio I made for the homework from section 02-Advanced CSS. This includes an HTML file with all the site content as well as a CSS stylesheet to format the site for both desktop and mobile. I made this site to show my proficency with both HTML and CSS in a portfolio style that I will end up returning to for job applications. Through this homework I was able to (for the most part) apply what I learned in a concrete way and notice small mistakes I tend to make (again, for the most part).

## Table of Contents

- README file
- index.html: the file used for the content of the site
- reset.css: the file used to reset any style from the browser on the site before implementing my own stylesheet
- style.css: the file that contains my own style for the site content
